# Vision — Orbital Compute Cluster (OCC)

The Orbital Compute Cluster is not just another supercomputer. It is the first step toward civilization-scale computing in space — a modular, radiation-hardened system designed to provide zettaflop-class performance in orbit.

## Why in Orbit?

Earth is constrained by atmosphere, gravity, and land. As Astrava expands toward a multiplanetary future, we need computation that is:
Unbounded in scale — not limited by terrestrial infrastructure.
Hardened against natural risks — free from floods, earthquakes, and national power grids.
Integrated with space operations — directly supporting asteroid mining, long-duration missions, orbital industry, and planetary expansion.
The OCC embodies this shift. It represents a platform for humanity’s most demanding calculations, from advanced physics simulations and AI alignment research, to navigation, resource management, and biosphere modeling.

## Modular by Design

The architecture of the Cluster is deliberately modular. Each segment — from the chip arrays to the power spines and laser communication rings — is designed to be replaceable, upgradable, and expandable. Over decades, this allows Astrava to scale linearly from the first deployment to an entire constellation of orbital data centers.

## Compute as Civilization Infrastructure

We see computation not as a tool, but as infrastructure for civilization itself. Just as electricity grids defined the industrial age, orbital computing will define the space age. With it, Astrava can:
- Run planetary-scale simulations to guide terraforming and asteroid mining.
- Operate autonomous fleets across the Solar System with high reliability.
- Train advanced AI systems in a secure, controlled, and physically isolated environment.
- Coordinate post-scarcity economics where material abundance is balanced by information mastery.

## A Work of Technology and Art

Beyond pure function, the Orbital Compute Cluster is envisioned as a masterpiece of technological architecture. Millions of infrared laser links weave a living web of data between modules, creating a structure that — though invisible to the naked eye — becomes an awe-inspiring display when seen through sensitive instruments. It is a cathedral of light and computation in orbit, a symbol of human ambition and precision.

## Our Commitment

The Orbital Compute Cluster is Astrava’s declaration that the future of humanity is computational, orbital, and infinite. By building this system, we lay the digital foundation for everything that follows: space industry, colonization, and eventually, the first true interplanetary civilization.
