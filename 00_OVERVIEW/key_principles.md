# Key Principles — Orbital Compute Cluster

The Orbital Compute Cluster is designed as a cornerstone of Astrava’s long-term mission: creating a scalable, secure, and civilization-level computational infrastructure in orbit. To succeed, we operate under the following guiding principles:

---

## 1. Modularity and Scalability

The cluster is composed of standardized, self-contained modules.
Each module integrates computing, power, cooling, and communication subsystems.
The architecture supports gradual expansion: new modules can be added without disrupting existing ones.

---

## 2. Reliability and Maintainability

All critical systems are radiation-hardened and designed with redundancy.
Faulty modules can be detached, replaced, or serviced from a nearby maintenance station.
Long-term operation is prioritized over peak performance at any cost.

---

## 3. Secure Computing Foundation

Security is embedded into hardware, firmware, and AstravaOS from the start.
Strong compartmentalization ensures that one compromised subsystem cannot endanger the whole.
The cluster must be resistant to both physical tampering and cyber intrusion.

---

## 4. Energy Efficiency

The cluster maximizes performance per watt through careful design of chips, cooling, and networking.
Waste heat is rejected through advanced radiators sized for orbital conditions.
Energy usage is monitored continuously to adapt workloads dynamically.

---

## 5. Long-Term Serviceability

Modules are built for multi-decade lifespans.
Maintenance is expected and planned: robotic servicing, modular swaps, and orbital refurbishment are part of the design.
Future upgrades (chips, antennas, power systems) must integrate smoothly with legacy modules.

---

## 6. Secure Sovereign Infrastructure

The Orbital Compute Cluster is not a commercial data center, but a strategic infrastructure asset.
Governance, access, and usage are carefully controlled under Astrava’s long-term vision.
Partner entities may lease compute capacity under Astrava’s terms, without ownership rights.

---

## 7. Transparency of Purpose

The cluster exists to advance civilizational goals:
Large-scale simulation and modeling.
Coordination of space infrastructure.
Enabling breakthroughs in science, energy, and industry.
Every step of development aligns with Astrava’s founding mission: enabling a post-scarcity, multiplanetary future.
