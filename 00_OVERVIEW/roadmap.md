# Roadmap – Astrava Orbital Compute Cluster

## Phase 0 – Foundation (2025–2028)

- Core Research:
  - Define requirements for orbital HPC (power density, thermal management, radiation tolerance, communication bandwidth).
  - Evaluate existing aerospace-grade computing hardware and identify what must be developed from scratch.
  - Begin AstravaOS development with ground-based test clusters.
- Simulation & Modeling:
  - Build digital twins for orbital cluster design, thermal radiation, orbital mechanics, and interconnect latency.
- Partnerships & Funding:
  - Secure collaborations with space agencies, universities, and industrial partners.
  - Establish supplier pipelines for radiation-hardened chips and modular satellite platforms.

## Phase 1 – Ground Demonstrators (2028–2031)

- Prototype Compute Modules:
  - Develop radiation-hardened computing modules with integrated memory.
  - Test fault-tolerance, redundancy, and error-correction mechanisms.
- Cluster Assembly:
  - Build a scalable ground cluster (100–500 modules) to validate AstravaOS orchestration and networking.
  - Stress-test interconnect protocols and redundancy under simulated failures.
- Environmental Testing:
  - Place compute modules in radiation chambers, vacuum chambers, and thermal cycling rigs to qualify designs for space.

## Phase 2 – Orbital Pilot (2032–2034)

- First Deployment:
  - Launch a small orbital cluster (5–20 modules).
  - Focus on validating thermal control, power delivery, and communication with Earth.
- Operations:
  - Demonstrate AstravaOS coordinating orbital hardware.
  - Run limited-scale workloads (AI training, physics simulations).
  - Collect multi-year reliability data.
- Serviceability:
  - Prove that modules can be detached, replaced, or repaired in orbit.

## Phase 3 – Scaled Orbital Cluster (2035–2039)

- Expansion:
  - Deploy clusters with hundreds of modules in LEO (Low Earth Orbit).
  - Establish nuclear or solar-nuclear hybrid power modules.
  - Implement advanced radiative cooling structures.
- Networking:
  - Create high-bandwidth optical communication links between modules and with Earth.
  - Begin cross-cluster interconnect experiments (multi-orbit networking).
- Applications:
  - Provide compute services for asteroid mission planning, space habitat simulations, and Earth-based research.
  - Train Astrava’s long-term AI systems in orbit under controlled conditions.

## Phase 4 – Interplanetary Compute Infrastructure (2040–2047)

- Distributed Network:
  - Establish orbital clusters beyond Earth (Lunar orbit, Mars transfer orbits, asteroid belt).
  - Interconnect them into a coherent AstravaOS-managed compute fabric.
- Civilizational Backbone:
  - Support continuous coordination of asteroid mining fleets, deep-space stations, and planetary bases.
  - Provide the computational core for Astrava’s broader vision of post-scarcity infrastructure.
