# System Architecture

### **Networking: A Self-Healing Laser Mesh**
Modules communicate using an extremely high-bandwidth laser mesh network. This setup creates a self-healing network; if a module fails, data is automatically rerouted through a nearby node, ensuring uninterrupted service. This architecture is designed to give the entire cluster the feel of a single, powerful machine.

### **Power: Self-Contained & Resilient**
Each module is a self-contained power unit, drawing energy from its own hexagon panel. This design choice dramatically increases the resilience of the cluster, as a power failure in one module will not affect others. The high-bandwidth laser links also act as a failsafe for data flow.

### **Security: Zero-Trust from the Ground Up**
**AstravaOS** implements a zero-trust security model with a hardware-based authentication protocol. For a user's workstation to connect to the cluster, it must have a specific, verifiable chip embedded in its network cable. This ensures that only trusted systems can communicate with the cluster, preventing unauthorized access at the most fundamental level.
