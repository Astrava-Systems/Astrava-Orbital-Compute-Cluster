# Astrava Architecture: A Modular Hexagonal Framework

The Astrava Orbital Computing Cluster is built upon a highly modular, scalable, and resilient architecture. The core principle is a decentralized system of interconnected units, allowing for easy expansion, repair, and mission-specific reconfiguration in a hostile orbital environment.

## The Hexagonal Unit: The Foundation

Each Hexagonal Unit serves as the foundational building block of the cluster. These units are designed with two primary functions:

* **Structural and Docking Interface:** The six sides of the hexagon provide secure, standardized docking points for other units and modules. This universal interface ensures flexibility and allows for the creation of complex, interconnected structures. The cluster will have a honeycomb-like shape.
* **Energy and Data Conduit:** The units are equipped with a hexagonal solar panel array to generate power and internal connections to distribute that power and data throughout the cluster. This design eliminates the need for a single, centralized power source and provides redundancy.

## Modular Components

Various modules can autonomously or robotically dock onto the Hexagonal Units, each serving a specific function:

* **Computing Core:** These modules contain the primary processing hardware for tasks like simulations, AI training, and drug discovery. They are designed to be swapped in or out easily, enabling upgrades or replacements without affecting the rest of the cluster.
* **Robotic Hub:** These modules house robotic arms for automated assembly, maintenance, and module replacement. They are strategically placed throughout the cluster to ensure every unit is within reach for servicing.
* **Specialized Modules:** The architecture is flexible enough to accommodate future modules for tasks like advanced data storage, communication arrays, or scientific instruments.

## Communication

Within the cluster, all computing modules communicate with each other using a high-bandwidth, low-latency mesh network. Each Computing Core is equipped with six lasers that face other cores, ensuring a robust and redundant communication system.

## Power

The entire power consumption of the cluster is provided by the individual Hexagon Plates, which act as high-efficiency solar panels. This decentralized power system ensures that even if one unit is damaged, the rest of the cluster can continue to operate.

## Scalability and Resilience

This modular, hexagonal approach provides two key benefits:

* **Scalability:** The cluster can grow incrementally by simply adding more Hexagonal Units and Computing Cores. This "add-on" approach avoids the need to launch a single, massive piece of hardware.
* **Resilience and Repairability:** A damaged unit or module can be isolated and swapped out by a Robotic Hub with minimal disruption to the overall cluster. This decentralized design prevents a single point of failure from crippling the entire system.
