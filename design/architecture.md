# Astrava Architecture: A Modular Hexagonal Framework

The Astrava Orbital Computing Cluster is built upon a highly modular, scalable, and resilient architecture. The core principle is a decentralized system of interconnected units, allowing for easy expansion, repair, and mission-specific reconfiguration in a hostile orbital environment.

## The Astrava Unit: The Foundational Building Block
The cluster is composed of individual Astrava Units. Each Unit contains two primary components: a Hexagon Platform and a Docking Module. This architecture separates the long-lasting structural components from the modular, replaceable components.

The deployment of these components is also modular. New units arrive split, meaning one rocket can carry multiple Hexagon Platforms and another rocket can carry multiple Computing Modules. The modules are then autonomously docked to the platforms in orbit, allowing for on-demand expansion and maintenance.

## The Hexagon Platform: The Backbone
Each Hexagon Platform serves as the core backbone of an Astrava Unit. It is a durable, long-lasting component with a dual function:

- **Power & Protection:** The platform's sun-facing side is a large solar panel. The platform itself provides a crucial shadow on its reverse side, protecting the sensitive electronic modules docked there from direct sunlight.

- **Structure & Docking:** The six outer sides of the hexagon provide secure, standardized docking ports. This allows other entire Astrava Units to connect, forming a large, interconnected honeycomb-like structure.

## The Docking Module: The Functional Components
These modules attach to the shaded side of a Hexagon Platform. They receive power directly from the platform and are designed to be replaced or upgraded over time. There are a few types of modules:

- **Computing Module:** These contain the primary processing hardware for tasks like simulations and AI training. Each Computing Module is equipped with high-speed lasers for communication, creating a low-latency, high-bandwidth mesh network between adjacent modules.

- **Robotic Hub:** This module houses robotic arms for automated assembly, maintenance, and module replacement.

- **Communication Module:** This module handles communication with Earth and other off-cluster entities.

## Scalability, Resilience, and Network Design
This modular, hexagonal approach provides three key benefits:

- **Scalability:** The cluster can grow incrementally by adding more Hexagonal Units and Computing Cores. This "add-on" approach avoids the need for a single, massive piece of hardware. New units can dock onto the six sides of an existing Hexagon Platform, allowing for continuous, on-demand expansion.

- **Resilience and Repairability:** A damaged unit or module can be isolated and swapped out by a Robotic Hub with minimal disruption to the overall cluster. This decentralized design prevents a single point of failure from crippling the entire system.

- **Network Design:** The data network is entirely separate from the power and structure. It is a decentralized, laser-based mesh network only between the Computing Modules. The Hexagon Platforms handle all power and structural integrity, while the modules handle all computation and communication.
