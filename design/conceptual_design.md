# Conceptual Design: An Orbital Ecosystem

Astrava is not merely a collection of hardware; it is designed as a self-sustaining **orbital ecosystem**. This concept guides all design decisions, from the physical structure to the operational philosophy.

## Form Follows Function

The cluster's physical design is based on the hexagonal honeycomb structure. This pattern provides unparalleled structural stability, efficient use of space, and a naturally scalable framework. The appearance is a direct result of its modular and decentralized nature, emphasizing its organic, evolving form rather than a monolithic design.

## The Roles of the Ecosystem

Within the Astrava ecosystem, each component has a defined role:

* **Hexagon Plates** are the lifeblood, providing power and a stable base for the entire structure.
* **Robotic Hubs** are the maintainers and builders, autonomously adding new modules, performing repairs, and ensuring the health of the cluster.
* **Computing Cores** are the "brains" of the ecosystem, dedicated to high-performance tasks like complex simulations, advanced AI training, and scientific projects such as drug discovery.

## The Core Product

Astrava's core business model is to provide a powerful computing service to a variety of clients. Internally, the company will conduct its own highly-complex simulations and research. This internal intellectual property (IP) will then be licensed to external partners, creating a unique revenue model and ensuring a constant feedback loop for improving the cluster's capabilities.
