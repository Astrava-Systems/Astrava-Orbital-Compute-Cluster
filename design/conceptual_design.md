# Conceptual Design: An Ecosystem of Compute

The Orbital Compute Cluster is built as a highly resilient and autonomous ecosystem, where each unit is both a contributor and a caretaker.

### **The Hexagon Plate: A Unified Foundation**
Every unit begins with a **25-meter hexagonal solar plate**. This is far more than just a power source; it is the core structural element. It contains:
* **Solar Collection**: A highly efficient photovoltaic surface that collects direct, uninterrupted solar energy.
* **Power & Data Bus**: A standardized, unified bus system that provides power and high-speed data connections to all attached modules.
* **Docking Ports**: A system of docking ports and structural supports for attaching other modules.

### **The Computing & Robotic Modules**
Attached to the hexagon plate are two types of specialized modules, with a target ratio of 95% compute to 5% robotics.
* **Computing Modules**: These self-contained units house the processors and memory. **Chip-to-chip** communication within a module is handled by **optical fiber** for maximum speed.
* **Robotic Hubs**: A small percentage of the units will contain specialized robotic hubs. These hubs, similar to the multi-armed robots on the ISS, will handle the maintenance and assembly of the cluster.

### **Autonomy & Upgradability**
The cluster is designed for full autonomy. When a new compute module is launched, the robotic hubs will autonomously capture and dock it to a hexagon plate. When a module needs an upgrade or repair, the robots will simply detach it and replace it with a new one. This ensures the cluster can evolve continuously without human intervention, making it truly a future-proof system.
