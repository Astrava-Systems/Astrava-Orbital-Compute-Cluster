# Scaling Plan

Astrava is designed to start small and grow exponentially. Our scaling plan is defined by a phased approach that mitigates risk and optimizes for cost-effective deployment.

## The Minimum Viable Cluster (MVC)

The smallest functional Astrava cluster will consist of three essential modules:

1.  A **Seed Module**: This module provides initial pathfinding, communication with Earth, and core operational software.
2.  A **Robotic Hub**: This unit is responsible for assembling and maintaining the cluster.
3.  A **Computing Core**: This first core, attached to its own Hexagon Plate, represents the initial processing power of the cluster.

While this MVC would have limited power, it proves the core concept and sets the stage for future expansion.

## Launch and Assembly Strategy

All parts of the Astrava cluster will be prefabricated on Earth. The launch strategy is designed to be highly efficient:

1.  **Phase 1: Hexagon Deployment:** The initial launches will primarily focus on deploying the Hexagon Units. Because they require more volume, a single rocket can deliver a few at a time.
2.  **Phase 2: Modular Expansion:** Subsequent launches will deliver a higher density of computing and other specialized modules. A single rocket could carry multiple computing cores, which will then autonomously attach to the pre-deployed Hexagon Units.

This approach allows the cluster to expand over time, avoiding the high cost and risk of launching a single, massive structure.

## Future Growth

The Astrava cluster is designed for long-term growth. Future scaling will be enabled by:

* **Component Upgrades:** As new chip architectures and hardware become available, newer, more powerful modules can be launched and swapped in by the Robotic Hubs.
* **Expanding the Ecosystem:** The ultimate goal is to have a cluster with hundreds/thousends of modules, providing a massive, globally-accessible supercomputer in space. This will unlock capabilities that are not possible on Earth, such as real-time, ultra-fast data processing for space exploration.
