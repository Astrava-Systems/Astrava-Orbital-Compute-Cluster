# Scaling Plan: From Launch to Exaflop

Our scaling strategy is designed to be phased, modular, and resilient.

### **Phase 1: The Initial Launch**
The first deployment will consist of a single solar-powered compute module. This unit will provide the initial compute power necessary for our first projects and serve as the foundation for all future expansion.

### **Phase 2: Exponential Growth**
Once the first module is operational, we will begin a continuous deployment of additional solar-powered compute modules. These units will dock onto the hexagon panels of existing modules, expanding the cluster in a self-similar, fractal-like pattern.

* Each new module adds its own power source (the 25m hexagon panel) and compute capacity, contributing to the overall mesh network.
* The laser networking system is designed for this exponential growth, allowing new modules to seamlessly integrate into the network without major reconfiguration.

### **Phase 3: Reaching the Exaflop Range**
By continuously adding modules, the cluster will scale to the multi-exaflop range. This strategy ensures that we can meet growing demand by expanding our capacity incrementally, without the need for massive, single-launch deployments.
