# AstravaOS: A Self-Managing Orbital Operating System

AstravaOS is the intelligent core of the Astrava mission. It is a highly resilient, autonomous operating system designed to manage every aspect of the orbital compute cluster, from power distribution to module repair. Its primary goal is to abstract the complexity of the hardware and orbital environment, providing a simple, powerful platform for orbital computation.

## Core Capabilities

- **Autonomous Resource Management:** AstravaOS will intelligently manage the cluster's distributed resources. This includes optimizing power consumption from the solar arrays, directing computational workloads to available modules, and actively managing thermal regulation to prevent overheating.

- **Self-Healing & Fault Tolerance:** The OS is designed to be highly resilient. It will continuously monitor the health of all units and modules. If a component fails or degrades, AstravaOS will isolate the issue, reroute power and data, and command the robotic hubs to perform automated repairs or replace the faulty module with a new one.

- **Dynamic Network Management:** The OS manages the entire laser-based mesh network. It will dynamically reconfigure network paths to maintain high-bandwidth communication and low latency, ensuring a seamless data flow between all computing modules.

- **Cyber-Resilience:** Given the sensitive nature of its mission, AstravaOS will be built with a security-first mindset. It will employ advanced cyber-resilience protocols to protect the cluster from external threats and ensure the integrity of the data and systems.

- **Simplified Interface:** AstravaOS will provide a high-level API for users. This allows clients to submit massive workloads without needing to understand the underlying orbital architecture. The OS will handle all the complex task distribution, scheduling, and resource allocation behind the scenes.

AstravaOS is not just software; it is the intelligence that enables the entire cluster to function as a single, cohesive, and powerful entity.
