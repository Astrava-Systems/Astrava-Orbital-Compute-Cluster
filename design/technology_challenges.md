# Technology Challenges

Building the Orbital Compute Cluster requires solving several unprecedented engineering challenges. We are actively seeking collaborators with expertise in these areas.

### **1. Advanced Solar Panel Deployment**
The hexagon solar panels are massive (25m diameter) and must be designed to be tightly folded for launch and then reliably unfurl in a zero-gravity environment. This requires expertise in mechanical and materials engineering.

### **2. Autonomous Assembly & Maintenance**
The cluster will be too large and complex for human assembly. We need to develop advanced robotics and autonomous systems to handle the docking of new modules, routine maintenance, and in-orbit repairs.

### **3. Extreme Thermal Management**
The vast amount of waste heat generated by a large-scale supercomputer must be dissipated. While the vacuum of space provides a perfect heat sink, designing the massive radiative cooling systems and heat pipe networks for each module is a significant engineering task.

### **4. Space-Grade Components**
All components, from the solar panels to the computing cores, must be hardened against cosmic radiation, solar flares, and extreme thermal cycling.
