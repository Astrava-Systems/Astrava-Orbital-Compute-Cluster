# Technology Challenges

Building the Orbital Computing Cluster requires solving several unprecedented engineering challenges. These challenges are not obstacles to our vision; they are the road map of the problems we are solving, and an invitation to collaborators with expertise in these areas.

### 1. Advanced Solar Panel Deployment

The Hexagon solar panels are massive (with a planned 25m diameter) and must be designed to be tightly folded for launch. The system then needs to reliably and autonomously unfurl in a zero-gravity environment. This requires advanced expertise in mechanical engineering, robotics, and material science.

### 2. Space-Grade Component Hardening

All components, from the computing cores to the solar panels, must be engineered to withstand the extreme environment of Low Earth Orbit. This includes designing for and protecting against cosmic radiation, solar flares, and rapid thermal cycling. The durability and efficiency of the Hexagon Plates are of particular importance, as they must generate power while also resisting this harsh environment.

### 3. Extreme Thermal Management

A large-scale supercomputer generates a vast amount of waste heat. While the vacuum of space provides a perfect heat sink, designing the massive radiative cooling systems and heat pipe networks for each individual module is a significant engineering task that requires innovative solutions.

### 4. Autonomous Assembly & Maintenance

The Astrava cluster is too large and complex for human assembly. We must develop advanced, fully autonomous robotic systems to handle the docking of new modules, routine maintenance, and in-orbit repairs. The robotic hubs within the cluster are a key part of this self-sustaining solution.

### 5. The Launch Bottleneck

The cost and logistics of launching hardware into orbit remain a major barrier. Our modular, prefabricated design directly addresses this by allowing us to launch individual, standardized components on smaller, more cost-effective vehicles.

### 6. Funding

Developing, testing, and launching hardware into space is incredibly expensive. Our strategy is to build credibility and demonstrate the concept in phases. By proving the viability of our core technologies on a small scale, we will attract the necessary investment from both private and public sectors.
