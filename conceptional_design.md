# Orbital Compute Cluster – Conceptional Design

---

## Design Philosophy
1. **Modularity** – Each compute unit is independent, with its own power, cooling, and interconnect.  
2. **Scalability** – Start small, then expand in number and performance.  
3. **Cost-conscious** – Avoid unnecessary “space-grade” pricing; focus on parts that must truly be hardened.  
4. **Maintainability** – Damaged or outdated modules can be swapped out in orbit.

## Example Module Composition
- **Compute chips**: Custom large-surface radiation-hardened designs (concept: 50x50 cm plates, stackable).  
- **Cooling**: Radiative fins + conductive layers.  
- **Power**:  
  - Nuclear for seed cluster  
  - Solar for expansion modules  
- **Networking**: Fiber-like interconnects within a module, laser between modules.

## Deployment Concept
- First deployment: **7 modules** (6 high-spec + 1 nuclear seed core).  
- Target: **>1 exaflop performance** as a demonstrator system.  
- Later stages: Addition of hundreds of solar modules, scaling capacity.

## Applications
- Abstract for now, but include AI, science, and industrial research at scale.
