# Orbital Compute Cluster – Roadmap

---

## Phase 1 – Foundation (Present → 2027)
- Publish initial concepts and open community collaboration.  
- Build a **core team** of engineers, researchers, and visionaries.  
- Begin early technical studies, simulation work, and design validation.  

---

## Phase 2 – Seed Cluster (Late 2020s)
- Deploy first **7-module system** (>1 exaflop).  
- Demonstrate orbital-scale computing.  
- Establish nuclear power reliability in orbit.  

---

## Phase 3 – Expansion (2030s)
- Deploy solar-powered modules in batches.  
- Scale compute power into multi-exaflop and zettaflop territory.  
- Grow orbital infrastructure for maintenance and upgrades.  

---

## Phase 4 – Applications
- Unlock breakthroughs in material science, medicine, and AI.  
- Support asteroid mining, space infrastructure, and long-term civilization projects.
