# Orbital Compute Cluster â€“ Principles

## 1. **Modular Scalability**  
   - Each compute node functions independently but connects via high-speed interlinks.

## 2. **Low-Latency Communication**  
   - Prioritize network designs that minimize signal delay for both Earth-orbit and inter-orbit operations.

## 3. **Sustainability**  
   - Use solar power arrays and thermal management to ensure continuous operation.

## 4. **Fault Tolerance**  
   - Redundant nodes and failover systems prevent downtime in case of failure.

## 5. **International Accessibility**  
   - Provide secure but open frameworks for research, commercial, and government use.

## 6. **Rapid Upgrade Path**  
   - Nodes are hot-swappable, enabling incremental improvements without shutting down the cluster.

## 7. **Cybersecurity**  
   - Implement encryption, authentication, and anomaly detection as core functions, not add-ons.
