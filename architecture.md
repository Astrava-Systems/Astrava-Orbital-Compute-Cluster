# Orbital Compute Cluster – Architecture

## Purpose of This Document

This document describes the modular architectural design of Astrava’s Orbital Compute Cluster. The system is designed for scalable, long-term deployment in Low Earth Orbit, starting from a single module and growing to a full computational ring capable of exascale-to-zetascale performance.

## Module Design

- **Dimensions**: 16 m (length) × 3 m × 3 m per module  
- **Internal Structure**:
  - 15 vertical layers of 50 × 50 cm chip plates
  - Each plate carries dense 2 nm chip arrays
  - Plates are interconnected via high-speed **optical fiber**
  - **Passive cooling channels** run between plates for efficient thermal management

---

## Ring Layout

- **Mounting**: Modules are attached by their **short 3 m side** to the circular truss  
- **Orientation**: 16 m length curves tangentially around the ring
- **Truss Diameter**: 150–180 m  
- **Configuration**:
  - Dual concentric module rings (double ring)
  - A central **radiator corridor** runs between the two rings
- **Capacity**:
  - ~145 modules per line × 2 = ~290 total modules (initial full ring)
- **Scalability**:
  - System can begin operation with just a **single module**
  - Modules can be added progressively without disruption
- **Expansion**:
  - Spare spacing may allow additional modules in later growth phases

## Power and Cooling

- **Primary Power**: Compact nuclear reactor mounted separately (top of central spine)
- **Backup Power**: Large-area solar arrays
- **Cooling System**:
  - Heat transfer fluid moves heat from modules to radiators
  - **Radiators face deep space** for passive heat rejection
- **Solar Panel Roles**:
  - Provide backup power
  - Act as thermal radiators
  - Serve as **sunshades**, reducing direct solar load on compute ring

---

## Connectivity

- **Intra-Module**: Chip-to-chip and plate-to-plate via high-bandwidth optical fiber  
- **Module-to-Module**: Fiber optic backbone ring with failover links  
- **External Communication**:
  - Encrypted **laser uplinks/downlinks** to Earth and other orbital assets  
  - Inter-ring data pipes with high throughput and error correction  

---

## Assembly and Maintenance

- Modules are launched **fully prefabricated**
- **Robotic assembly arms** position and attach modules in orbit
- Damaged modules can be:
  - **Isolated**
  - **Detached**
  - **Replaced** without impacting system integrity or uptime
- Central truss provides mounting, power routing, and robotic mobility paths

---

## Rationale for Short-Side Mounting

Mounting each module by its **3 m face** onto the ring structure:
- Enhances **structural rigidity**
- Allows for **denser circular packing**
- Simplifies thermal and data routing
- Enables future upgrades without major redesign
