# Orbital Compute Cluster â€“ Operations

## 1. Pre-Launch Preparation
- Compute nodes tested on Earth for performance and stability.
- Preloaded with required operating systems and mission software.

## 2. Deployment
- Modules launched individually or in batches.
- Automatically dock with cluster hub via standardized ports.

## 3. In-Orbit Operation
- Nodes join distributed compute fabric.
- Load balancing distributes tasks across available hardware.

## 4. Maintenance
- Robotic servicing arms handle module swaps.
- Faulty nodes deorbited or moved to repair dock.

## 5. Data Flow
- Primary communication via laser links.
- Redundant RF channels for backup.

## 6. Security Protocols
- Continuous threat monitoring.
- Automatic isolation of compromised nodes.
