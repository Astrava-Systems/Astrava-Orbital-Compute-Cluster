# You Can Build the Impossible. We Need You.

This is not a traditional job application. We are looking for people who are driven by a bold, audacious vision. If you have the expertise to solve problems that have never been tackled before and the passion to build humanityâ€™s first large-scale supercomputer in space, we want to hear from you.

Our project requires expertise in:

* **Space Systems Engineering**: For orbital mechanics, structural design, and thermal dynamics.
* **Nuclear & Mechanical Engineering**: For the design and operation of the "seed module" and overall structural integrity.
* **High-Performance Computing & OS Design**: To develop a new OS that can manage a zettaflop-scale, distributed system.
* **Robotics & Autonomous Systems**: For assembly and maintenance in orbit.
* **Advanced Material Science**: To create components that can withstand the extreme conditions of space.

If you are a visionary problem-solver, reach out and help us build the future.
