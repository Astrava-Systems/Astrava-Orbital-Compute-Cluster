# A Personal Invitation to the Astrava Mission

### A note from the founder:

Welcome. My name is Matteo, and I'm a 16-year-old with a vision for humanity's future in space. When you read about this project, you'll see a mission that sounds ambitious and maybe even a little crazy. Thatâ€™s because it is. But I believe that the greatest challenges are the ones that are truly worth solving.

This project is in its **pre-founding phase**. This means we are building the core technology concepts and assembling the founding team. We are not yet a company with a salary; we are a movement built on a shared passion for a better future. This is a call for true believers.

If you are driven by a purpose larger than yourself and want to be a part of the journey from the very beginning, we want you on our team.

### Who We Are Looking For

We are looking for people who are passionate about our mission, no matter their skillset. We need thinkers, creators, and doers.

* **Engineers & Scientists:** Help us refine our concepts for thermal management, power distribution, robotics, and more.
* **Coders:** Help us conceptualize **AstravaOS**, our self-managing orbital operating system.
* **3D Artists & Animators:** Help us bring our vision to life with stunning visuals and animations for our YouTube videos and social media.
* **Graphic Designers & Writers:** Help us create clear, powerful documentation and build our brand.
* **Visionaries:** If you have big ideas about space, technology, or the future, we want to hear them.

Your creativity and dedication are just as essential as code.
