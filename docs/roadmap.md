# Project Roadmap

The development of the Orbital Compute Cluster is divided into three key phases.

### **Phase 1 (2025-2027): Foundation**

* **Conceptual Design**: Finalize the core architectural design of the modular units, power systems, and networking protocols.
* **Core Team Formation**: Build a small, dedicated team of visionary engineers and scientists to refine the initial concepts.
* **Business Planning & Seed Funding**: Establish Astrava Corp. as a legal entity and secure initial funding to support research and development.

### **Phase 2 (2027-2030): Engineering & Prototype**

* **Component Design**: Finalize detailed blueprints for the compute modules, nuclear reactor, and laser networking system.
* **Ground-Based Prototype**: Build and test functional prototypes of the compute modules and the core power systems in a controlled environment.
* **Supply Chain Development**: Partner with aerospace, nuclear, and semiconductor companies to secure the materials and components needed for orbital deployment.

### **Phase 3 (2030+): Orbital Deployment & Scaling**

* **Launch & Assembly**: Begin a phased deployment, starting with the launch of the **nuclear-powered "seed module"** and the initial six "high-spec" compute modules.
* **Scaling Operations**: Continuously launch and assemble additional solar-powered "low-spec" compute modules to expand the cluster's compute capacity into the multi-exaflop and, eventually, zettaflop range.
* **Client Onboarding**: Begin providing orbital compute services to scientific and corporate clients.
