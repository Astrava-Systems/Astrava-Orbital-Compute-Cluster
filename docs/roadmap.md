# Project Roadmap: A Journey to the Stars

The development of the Orbital Compute Cluster is a phased, long-term effort that will lead to a fully operational company.

---

### **Phase 1: Foundational Development (Current - 2027+)**
Our primary focus is on turning the vision into a viable business.
* **Architectural Finalization**: We will use this period to refine the core design of our solar units, compute modules, and the self-healing laser network. This includes detailed modeling of thermal management and power systems.
* **Core Team & Strategic Partnerships**: We will assemble a small, dedicated team of experts in aerospace, robotics, and computing. Simultaneously, Astrava-Systems will secure partnerships with launch providers and key technology suppliers.
* **Seed Funding**: We will work to secure initial seed funding to support foundational research, development, and business operations.

### **Phase 2: Engineering & Prototype (2027-2030+)**
This phase is about proving the technology and preparing for orbital deployment.
* **Ground-Based Prototype**: We will build and test a full-scale prototype of a single compute unit, including the unfurling of the 25-meter solar plate and the integration of a robotic maintenance arm. This will validate our core design principles.
* **AstravaOS Alpha Development**: Our team will begin development on the alpha version of AstravaOS, focusing on the core unified-chip architecture and hardware-based security protocols.
* **Manufacturing Plan**: We will finalize our manufacturing and assembly processes to ensure cost-effective and scalable production of all modules.

### **Phase 3: Orbital Deployment & Scaling (2030+)**
This is the operational phase where we begin generating revenue and scaling the cluster exponentially.
* **Initial Launch**: The first single compute unit will be launched into a low-Earth orbit. This will serve as our orbital testbed.
* **Exponential Growth**: We will begin a continuous deployment of new modules. Each new unit will autonomously dock with an existing one, growing the cluster in a fractal-like pattern.
* **Client Onboarding**: As the cluster scales, we will begin onboarding our first clients from the scientific, academic, and commercial sectors.
