# Project Roadmap

The development of the Orbital Compute Cluster is a phased, long-term effort that will lead to a fully operational company.

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Current - 2027)**

* **Conceptual Refinement**: Finalize the core architectural design of the modular units, solar power systems, and networking protocols.
* **Core Team Formation**: Build a small, dedicated team of visionary engineers and scientists to refine the initial concepts.
* **Business Planning & Seed Funding**: Establish Astrava Corp. as a legal entity and secure initial funding to support research and development. This phase is about turning the vision into a viable business.

### **Phase 2: Engineering & Prototype (2027-2030)**

* **Component Design**: Finalize detailed blueprints for the compute modules, solar array deployment, and laser networking system.
* **Ground-Based Prototype**: Build and test functional prototypes of the solar-powered compute modules in a controlled environment to prove the technology's viability.
* **Supply Chain Development**: Partner with aerospace and semiconductor companies to secure the materials and components needed for orbital deployment.

### **Phase 3: Orbital Deployment & Scaling (2030+)**

* **Launch & Assembly**: Begin a phased deployment, starting with the launch of the first compute module.
* **Scaling Operations**: Continuously launch and assemble additional solar-powered compute modules to expand the cluster's compute capacity into the multi-exaflop range.
* **Client Onboarding**: Begin providing orbital compute services to scientific and corporate clients, generating revenue and fueling future expansion.
