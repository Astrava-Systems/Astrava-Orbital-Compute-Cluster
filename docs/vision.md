# Our Mission: Computing the Future from Orbit

Current Earth-based supercomputers are constrained by physical limitations: power, cooling, and the sheer scale required for the next generation of scientific challenges. Our mission is to move this infrastructure off-planet.

The **Orbital Compute Cluster** is a modular system that can be expanded to the zettaflop range and beyond. It will address problems that are too massive for traditional systems, including:

* **Large-Scale Simulations**: Modeling complex material properties and environmental systems with unprecedented fidelity.
* **Drug Discovery**: Rapidly simulating molecular interactions to discover new treatments and cures.
* **AI Acceleration**: Training and running AI models at a scale that is currently unfeasible, unlocking new capabilities and understanding.

The cluster operates on **AstravaOS**, a custom operating system designed to treat the entire cluster as a single, unified compute resource, ensuring maximum efficiency and security.
