# Conceptual Design: A Modular, Resilient Orbital Architecture

The Orbital Compute Cluster is built around a two-tiered, modular design for power and compute.

### **1. The "Seed Module"**
The project begins with a single, **nuclear-powered "seed module."** This module contains a miniaturized reactor capable of providing sufficient power for the first **multi-exaflop** configuration. This initial deployment will consist of the seed module plus six "high-spec" compute modules.

### **2. The Compute Modules**
Each compute module is a self-contained unit powered by a large, 25-meter diameter hexagon-shaped solar panel. These panels are designed to be tightly folded for launch and then unfurl in orbit.

A key design insight is that these large panels will block sunlight, providing a shadow for the compute unit behind them, which aids in passive cooling. The compute core itself and its chips will be extra radiation-hardened to ensure longevity in the space environment.
