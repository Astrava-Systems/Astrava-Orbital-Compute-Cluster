# Business Plan Summary: Scaling Compute, Powering Humanity

### **1. The Market Opportunity**
The demand for high-performance computing is outstripping supply. Earth-based supercomputers are limited by power infrastructure, physical space, and cooling challenges. This creates a massive market opportunity for a new platform that can bypass these constraints. We will serve high-value markets, including:

* **Pharmaceuticals**: Rapidly accelerating drug discovery and clinical trial simulations.
* **AI & Machine Learning**: Providing unprecedented scale for training next-generation AI models.
* **Materials Science**: Simulating new materials and their properties at an atomic level.

### **2. Monetization Strategy**
Our primary revenue stream will be a **Compute-as-a-Service (CaaS)** model. Clients will purchase time on the Orbital Compute Cluster to run their simulations and AI models. This will be a premium service offering superior performance, a secure environment, and the ability to handle larger problem sets than any terrestrial system. We will also explore licensing AstravaOS for specialized applications.

### **3. Competitive Advantage**
Our key differentiators are:

* **Unmatched Scale**: Our modular, solar-powered design allows for virtually unlimited expansion.
* **Cost Efficiency**: We eliminate the high costs of cooling and land acquisition associated with terrestrial data centers.
* **Resilience**: The self-contained, laser-networked modules create a robust, fault-tolerant system.
* **Security**: The hardware-level zero-trust system ensures a secure environment for sensitive data and research.
