# Astrava Orbital Compute Cluster: Building Humanity's First Off-Planet Infrastructure

**The Orbital Compute Cluster is a civilization-scale initiative by Astrava-Systems to build humanity's first large-scale AI and scientific acceleration hub in space. We are not just creating a supercomputer; we are pioneering a new frontier of human capability.**

On Earth, compute is constrained by power grids, cooling infrastructure, and physical land. In orbit, we find a canvas of unlimited solar energy, a perfect vacuum for passive cooling, and the freedom to build without terrestrial limits. Astrava is a mission to unlock this potential, creating a modular, autonomous, and infinitely scalable supercomputing platform.

Our work will serve as the engine for breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, accelerate cures for diseases through exascale drug discovery, and model the future of our planet with unprecedented fidelity. We are building the computational backbone for a better, more intelligent future for all of humanity.
