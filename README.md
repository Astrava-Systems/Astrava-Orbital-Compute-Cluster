# Astrava Orbital Compute Cluster

**We are building humanity's first orbital AI supercomputer.**

Astrava's Orbital Compute Cluster is a civilization-scale initiative to accelerate scientific discovery and the development of artificial intelligence. By leveraging the unique advantages of space—unlimited solar energy, a perfect vacuum, and extreme cold for radiative cooling—we are designing a modular supercomputer that can scale far beyond what is possible on Earth.

This project will serve as humanity's first large-scale scientific and AI hub in orbit, tackling problems that require zettaflop-scale compute power, from large-scale material simulations to exascale drug discovery.

### **Long-Term Vision**
Our vision is to build a scalable, resilient compute infrastructure in space, a hub for humanity's most ambitious projects. This repository documents our journey from concept to design and, eventually, to orbital deployment.
