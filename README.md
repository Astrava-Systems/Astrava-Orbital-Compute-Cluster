# Astrava: Humanity's First Modular Orbital Compute Cluster

**The mission is simple: to build a scalable, sustainable, and powerful computing infrastructure in orbit, powered entirely by the sun. Astrava will provide the essential compute for solving humanity's greatest challenges and enabling our expansion into space.**

### **The Challenge**

As humanity pushes the boundaries of AI, research, and space exploration, the demand for computing power is growing exponentially. Traditional data centers are resource-intensive and face physical limitations on Earth. We need a new solution.

### **The Solution: Astrava**

Astrava is a revolutionary approach to orbital compute. Instead of building a single, monolithic station, we are designing a self-assembling cluster of modular hexagonal plates.

**Key features of the Astrava concept:**

* **Modular & Scalable:** The cluster grows by adding more hexagonal plates, which are autonomous, self-powering, and robotic.
* **Solar Powered:** Each module is equipped with solar panels, making the entire system sustainable and independent of terrestrial power grids.
* **Autonomous & Resilient:** The cluster will manage itself, perform maintenance, and grow without the need for human intervention.
* **Beyond Earth:** By moving compute into space, we can reduce latency for orbital operations and free up valuable energy and resources on Earth.

### **Roadmap & Vision**

Our journey begins here, in the pre-founding phase. The goal is to build a mission so compelling that we can attract the talent and resources to make it a reality.

1.  **Phase I: Community & Vision (Pre-Founding)** - Define the core mission, business model, and technology concepts. Build a passionate community of collaborators.
2.  **Phase II: Design & Prototype** - Develop detailed technical designs, engineering concepts, and 3D models.
3.  **Phase III: Founding** - Formally establish the company and secure initial funding.
