# Orbital Compute Cluster
*"We want to accelerate humanity's advancement."*

The Orbital Compute Cluster is Astrava’s first step toward building civilization-scale infrastructure in space.  
It is designed as a scalable, modular supercomputer in orbit — optimized for breakthroughs in:

- Material Science  
- Drug Discovery  
- AI Training & Simulation  
- Large-scale Scientific Research  

This repository outlines the initial concepts, technical architecture, and roadmap for developing the cluster.

## Why
Human progress depends on computation. By moving large-scale compute into orbit, we bypass Earth’s limits on power, cooling, and scalability.  
Astrava’s vision is to create the infrastructure that enables the next leap in science, medicine, and industry.
