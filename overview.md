# Orbital Compute Cluster – Overview

The Orbital Compute Cluster is Astrava’s planned modular supercomputing network deployed in orbit.  
It provides a foundation for large-scale AI research and scientific discovery beyond Earth’s environmental limits.

## Core Idea
- **Modular architecture**: Each compute unit is a hexagonal module with integrated power and cooling.  
- **Scalability**: Modules interconnect to expand capacity from a single exaflop to potentially zettaflop-class performance.  
- **Two classes of modules**:
  - **High-spec nuclear seed modules** – Initial backbone, delivering exaflop-scale performance.  
  - **Low-spec solar modules** – Expansion units, each delivering several petaflops.  
- **Interconnection**: Laser and high-bandwidth RF links provide low-latency networking between modules.  

*Note: Dimensions and compute numbers are examples and may vary during development.*

## Purpose
The cluster supports breakthroughs in:
- Material science (new alloys, superconductors, advanced composites)  
- Drug discovery and medical research  
- Training and simulation for advanced AI systems  
- General scientific computing

## Why in Orbit
- **Energy availability**: Direct access to solar power and nuclear systems without terrestrial limits.  
- **Thermal management**: Radiative cooling in space provides far greater efficiency.  
- **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited room for expansion compared to Earth-based datacenters.
