# Orbital Compute Cluster

## Purpose

The Orbital Compute Cluster is Astrava’s large-scale, space-based computing system. Its core objectives are:

- Delivering **exascale-to-zetascale computing** for simulations, AI research, and advanced system design.
- Enabling breakthroughs in **drug discovery**, **planetary defense**, **asteroid mining optimization**, and **space infrastructure**.
- Providing **secure, scalable computational power** beyond Earth’s physical and geopolitical constraints.

---

## Location

- **Low Earth Orbit (LEO)** — selected altitude balances radiation protection and debris minimization.
- **Controlled access only** via Astrava’s secured ground systems; no public internet exposure.

---

## Key Features

### 🧠 Compute Power
- Initial performance target: **>1 Zettaflop** (10²¹ FLOPS).
- Fully scalable via modular expansions.

### ⚡ Power & Cooling
- **Primary power**: Compact nuclear reactor.
- **Secondary systems**: Solar panels that double as **shielding** and **radiative cooling surfaces**.

### 🧩 Structural Design
- **Modular architecture** with fail-safe redundancy.
- Modules arranged in **ring formation** around a central hub.
- Expansion via docking ports and **robotic servicing arms**.
- Damage to any single module is isolated — the system is resilient by design.

### 🔐 Security
- No external network access; only accessible via secure, authenticated Astrava terminals.
- Designed as a **hardened system** against intrusion, interference, or compromise.

## Applications

- **Physics & planetary simulations** — including orbital mechanics and impact scenarios.
- **AI training & alignment** — powering AstravaOS and specialized scientific AIs.
- **Molecular modeling & medicine** — for drug design and bioengineering.
- **Optimization systems** — for mining operations, energy networks, and habitat design.

## Design Principles

1. **Zetascale Ambition**  
   Begins with >1 Zettaflop, and expands via module launches.

2. **Orbital-First Computing**  
   Space-based location eliminates terrestrial limits on energy, cooling, and sovereignty.

3. **Security by Architecture**  
   Air-gapped, zero-trust infrastructure — hardened against tampering or surveillance.

4. **Energy Redundancy**  
   Dual-source: nuclear + solar. Failover mechanisms protect uptime.

5. **Modular Expansion**  
   Circular structure allows indefinite growth through ring extension.

6. **Civilization-Scale Focus**  
   Built to solve foundational problems: survival, expansion, discovery.

## Summary

The Orbital Compute Cluster is not just a data center in space — it’s the core nervous system of Astrava’s civilization-scale mission. With secure superintelligence, autonomous expansion logic, and deep-space simulation capacity, it sets the stage for humanity’s leap beyond Earth.
